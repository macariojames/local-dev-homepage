# local-dev-homepage
A homepage for all your locally developed websites. Just PHP, HTML/CSS, and (eventually) Bootstrap.

###Installation:
- After cloning the repo, copy the *index.php*, */public* folder, and *config-sample.php* to your local dev root directory. If you're on a Mac using MAMP, the default will be /Applications/MAMP/htdocs

- Update the config-sample.php information and then rename it to config.php
- Visit localhost in your web browser and you should be good to go!

Pretty simple thing. Let me know if you'd like me to add anything else to it. It does the job. 

Cheers and peace.
